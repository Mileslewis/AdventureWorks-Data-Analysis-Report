# AdventureWorks-Data-Analysis-Report
Project done during Generation UK Data Analytics Course using AdventureWorks Data

This project was completed in a 2 day time period in a group of 4. 
We were tasked with creating visualizations and writing a report to answer 6 questions using data from the AdventureWorks 2019 database using only SQL and Python.

Data was held in a local SQL Server and transferred into Python pandas Dataframes using sql queries. Data manipulation was done either during the queries or in python scripts and all visualizations were done using Matplotlib plots.

I have also done some touching up of all of the graphs after the project, based off of feedback and just things there wasn't enough time for during the project.

I will also probably make a Power Bi Dashboard, showing the same insights, as that seems like a much better way to do visualizations.
